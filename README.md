# Lynx Conveyor Controller

## Overview

The Lynx Conveyor Controller is an automated linear rail conveyor system designed for precise tray handling and positioning in industrial environments. This Arduino-based system controls a pneumatic shuttle that can transport trays between multiple stations with high precision positioning and comprehensive safety monitoring.

- **Pneumatic shuttle system** that can lock/unlock to grab and release trays during transport
- **Individual pneumatic tray locks** at each position (lock1, lock2, lock3) to secure trays
- **Tray detection sensors** throughout the system to track tray locations
- **Pressure monitoring** to ensure pneumatic systems have adequate pressure for operation
- **Manual positioning control** via MPG handwheel encoder interface
- **Comprehensive logging** with circular buffer for error diagnosis and system history
- **Serial and Ethernet command interfaces** with extensive help documentation
- **Automated test sequences** for system validation and troubleshooting
